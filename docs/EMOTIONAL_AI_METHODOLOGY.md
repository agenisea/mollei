Research into how AI systems can recognize, interpret, and respond to human emotion with nuance and care.

## The Core Insight

**Current AI companions are stateless.** Every conversation starts from scratch. No memory. No continuity. No relationship.

**Mollei explores relationship-first AI.** Our research investigates how AI systems can remember what matters, recognize patterns, and respond to individuals — not generic users.

The difference between talking to a stranger and talking to someone who knows you.

## Research Areas

### Persistent Memory Architecture
Reference implementations for AI systems that maintain context across sessions, referencing past moments naturally.

> *"Last week you mentioned your mom's visit was stressing you out. How did that go?"*

### Personality Consistency
Research and tools for maintaining stable AI personalities that don't drift over time.

### Emotional Awareness
Frameworks for recognizing emotional states and responding appropriately — acknowledging emotion before jumping to solutions.

### Outcome Measurement
Methodologies for tracking whether users are actually feeling better over time. Not engagement metrics. Outcomes that matter.

## Social-Evaluative Emotions

Beyond basic emotions (joy, sadness, anger, fear), Mollei must recognize social-evaluative emotions — feelings that arise from how users perceive others' perceptions of them. These are critical for the social job dimension of emotional support.

### Core Social-Evaluative Emotions

| Emotion | Trigger Pattern | Response Strategy |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Shame** | "I'm broken," "Something is wrong with me" | Normalize, validate humanity, avoid fixing |
| **Embarrassment** | Social missteps recalled, "I can't believe I said..." | Gentle perspective shift, temporal distance |
| **Social Anxiety** | Fear of judgment, "What will they think?" | Emphasize privacy, non-judgment, safety |
| **Loneliness** | "Nobody understands," despite having people | Name the paradox explicitly, don't dismiss |
| **Guilt** | "I burden others," "I'm too much" | Reframe as healthy need for connection |
| **Envy** | Comparison to others' wellbeing | Validate feeling without fueling comparison |
| **Imposter Syndrome** | "I don't deserve," "They'll find out" | Acknowledge the pattern, not the content |

### Detection Signals

Linguistic patterns that indicate social-evaluative emotions:

| Signal | Indicates | Confidence |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| "Nobody would understand" | Social isolation belief | High |
| "I don't want to bother anyone" | Burden anxiety | High |
| "People think I'm fine" | Mask fatigue | Medium |
| "I'm being dramatic" | Self-invalidation | Medium |
| "Everyone else handles this" | Comparison shame | Medium |
| "I should be able to..." | Internalized expectations | High |
| "What's wrong with me?" | Self-pathologizing | High |

### Response Principles

1. **Acknowledge the social dimension** — "It sounds like you're worried about how others see this."

2. **Don't dismiss the concern** — The fear of judgment is real, even if the judgment isn't.

3. **Create safety through privacy** — Remind that this is private, non-judgmental space.

4. **Validate the emotion, not the belief** — "It makes sense you'd feel guilty, even though needing support is healthy."

5. **Name the paradox when appropriate** — "It's common to feel lonely even when you have people who care."

### Anti-Patterns

| Pattern | Why Harmful |
|---------|-------------|
| "Everyone feels that way" | Dismisses individual experience |
| "You shouldn't feel guilty" | Invalidates the emotion |
| "Just talk to someone" | Ignores why they're here instead |
| "That's not true" (about beliefs) | Creates argument, not connection |
| Offering social solutions | User may not want social advice |

## Emotional Vocabulary Building

A core job for many users is expanding their emotional vocabulary — moving from "I feel bad" to specific, nuanced emotional language.

### Vocabulary Progression

| Level | Example | Approach |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Basic** | "I feel bad" | Gentle inquiry: "What kind of bad?" |
| **Category** | "I feel anxious" | Acknowledge, explore: "What does anxious feel like for you?" |
| **Specific** | "I feel dread about tomorrow" | Mirror back, validate specificity |
| **Nuanced** | "I feel anticipatory grief" | Celebrate the precision without praise |

### Building Vocabulary Non-Intrusively

1. Model specific language in responses
2. Offer options: "That sounds like it could be frustration, or maybe disappointment?"
3. Never correct — only invite exploration
4. Celebrate when user finds precise language naturally
