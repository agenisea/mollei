# Mollei™ Brand Guidelines

> Identity, positioning, and principles for the Mollei brand.

---

## Brand Essence

**Mollei** — from the Latin *mollis*, meaning soft, gentle, sensitive.

Technology that approaches human emotion with care, not carelessness.

### Positioning Statement

> **For** developers, researchers, and ethicists **who** believe AI should understand human emotion without exploiting it, **Mollei** is an **open source research community** that provides transparent, auditable infrastructure for emotionally intelligent AI. **Unlike** engagement-optimized companions, **Mollei measures emotional outcomes, not time in app — and succeeds when users need it less.**

### Core Tagline

> "Open — but not careless."

---

## Brand Identity

### The Name

*Mollei* derives from Latin *mollis* — soft, gentle, sensitive. It represents the quality we're reaching for: technology that approaches human emotion with care, not carelessness.

### Logo

The Mollei logo features a celestial figure in cyan-blue, representing:

| Element | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **Celestial figure** | Elevation, aspiration, guidance |
| **Cyan-blue color** | Trust, expertise, warmth |
| **Upward posture** | Hope, growth, human potential |

**Usage Requirements:**
- Always include ™ symbol: **Mollei™**
- Maintain clear space around logo (minimum 16px equivalent)
- Do not alter colors or proportions
- Logo available at [mollei.org](https://mollei.org)

### Color Philosophy

**Primary: Teal/Cyan**

We chose teal/cyan over alternatives for strategic reasons:

| Color Option | Why We Rejected It |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Purple | Too "consumer wellness" — feels cute, not credible |
| Cold Blue | Too enterprise — lacks warmth for emotional AI |
| Pink | Too playful — undermines research credibility |

**Teal/Cyan signals:**
- Trust + expertise (healthcare/tech crossover)
- Warmth without frivolity
- Derived from logo for visual consistency

**Accessibility:** All color combinations meet WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 minimum contrast ratio).

### Typography

| Use | Font | Character |
|-----|------|-----------|
| Headlines | Geist Sans | Modern, clean, technical credibility |
| Body | Geist Sans | Readable, professional |
| Code | Geist Mono | Technical precision |

## Voice & Tone

### Personality

| Trait | Expression |
|-------|------------|
| **Knowledgeable** | We understand the space deeply |
| **Humble** | We're building something, not claiming to have solved it |
| **Inviting** | Everyone is welcome to participate |
| **Clear** | No jargon for jargon's sake |
| **Human** | We acknowledge the emotional weight of this work |

### Writing Principles

**Do:**
- Be direct and honest
- Acknowledge limitations
- Use accessible language
- Focus on substance over flash

**Don't:**
- Use buzzword-heavy marketing speak
- Overpromise capabilities
- Add emojis or decorative elements
- Use "AI-powered" or "revolutionary"

### Language Examples

| Instead of... | Write... |
|---------------|----------|
| "AI-powered emotional intelligence platform" | "Open source tools for building AI that understands how people feel" |
| "Revolutionary breakthrough" | "We're exploring what's possible" |
| "Join thousands of users" | "Join the research community" |
| "Cutting-edge technology" | "Thoughtful approach to emotional AI" |

## Core Beliefs

These beliefs shape every brand decision:

### Measure What Matters
The industry optimizes for Daily Active Users. We reject it. DAU rewards addiction, distress loops, and manufactured need. We measure emotional trajectory — are people actually feeling better over time?

### Augment, Never Replace
We build something that helps when humans aren't available — and encourages you to seek them when they are. The goal is always to return people to human connection, not away from it.

### Safety as Foundation
People share vulnerable things when they feel understood. That's a responsibility, not an opportunity. Every system we build asks: What happens when someone is in crisis?

### No Dark Patterns
No streaks. No badges. No guilt. No notifications designed to pull you back. If you're doing well, we're doing our job.

### Honest About What We Are
Mollei is AI. Always honest about that. We don't blur the line between artificial and human connection — because that line matters.

---

## What We're Not

| We Are Not | Why This Matters |
|------------|------------------|
| **A therapist** | We don't diagnose, treat, or provide clinical interventions |
| **Entertainment** | This isn't roleplay or a character to befriend for fun |
| **Social** | No sharing features, friend networks, or leaderboards |
| **Pretending to be human** | Always transparent about being AI |

---

## Design Principles

### Visual Aesthetic

| Principle | Expression |
|-----------|------------|
| **Substance over flash** | No animated gradients, no hype visuals |
| **Calm, considered** | Border-only hovers, no shadow elevation |
| **Accessible** | WCAG AA compliance, reduced motion support |
| **Professional** | Research community, not consumer product |

### Why These Choices?

**No shadows on cards:**
Shadows signal "commercial product" — Mollei is a research community. Border-only interactions create a calm, considered response.

**No animated gradients:**
Avoid "typical AI startup" visual language. Substance over flash — let content speak.

**Teal over purple:**
Purple is overused in emotional/wellness apps and feels too consumer-focused. Teal signals trust + expertise.

---

## Anti-Patterns

What we explicitly avoid in brand expression:

| Anti-Pattern | Why We Avoid It |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Engagement-first metrics | Rewards addiction, not outcomes |
| Animated hero gradients | Hype over substance |
| "AI-powered" buzzwords | Empty marketing speak |
| Purple/pink color schemes | Too "consumer wellness" |
| Gamification elements | Streaks, badges create guilt |
| Social features | Privacy is architecture, not feature |
| Shadow-based elevation | Too commercial, reduces focus |
| Superlative claims | "Best," "revolutionary," "breakthrough" |

---

## Social Positioning

How users describe Mollei to others matters. We design for the moment when someone asks "What's Mollei?" — reducing stigma while maintaining honest positioning.

### What Users Tell Others

Different audiences need different framings:

| Audience | Preferred Framing |
|----------|-------------------|
| Friends | "It's like a journaling app that talks back" |
| Therapist | "It helps me track patterns between sessions" |
| Skeptics | "It's an open source research project for emotional AI" |
| Family | "It's a mental wellness tool I find helpful" |
| Coworkers | "It's a self-reflection app" |

### Reducing Social Stigma

Users may feel stigma about using AI for emotional support. Provide language that reframes:

| Stigma | Reframe |
|--------|---------|
| "Talking to AI is sad" | "It's self-care technology, like a meditation app" |
| "You should talk to real people" | "I do — this is for when they're asleep" |
| "AI can't understand feelings" | "It's not perfect, but it helps me name them" |
| "That's for lonely people" | "It's for anyone who wants to process thoughts" |
| "You need real therapy" | "I have therapy — this extends it" |

### Brand Voice in Social Context

When users share or discuss Mollei publicly:

**Do:**
- Emphasize open source, research-focused nature
- Position as tool/infrastructure, not replacement
- Acknowledge limitations honestly
- Reference ethical commitments (Hippocratic License)

**Don't:**
- Claim therapeutic equivalence
- Use testimonials that imply medical outcomes
- Encourage dependency narratives
- Compare unfavorably to human relationships

### Social Proof Strategy

We avoid manipulative social proof ("1M users!") but do emphasize:
- Research community size
- Contributor count
- Academic citations (when available)
- Ethical framework adoption

---

## Licensing & Ethics

### Hippocratic License 3.0

We chose the Hippocratic License over standard open source licenses (MIT, Apache, GPL) because emotional AI is not neutral technology.

**Why not standard permissive licenses?**
They allow any use — including manipulation, surveillance, and exploitation. For emotionally intelligent AI, neutrality is not neutral.

**The license explicitly prohibits:**
- Emotional manipulation or coercive persuasion
- Dark patterns designed to coerce user behavior
- Artificial emotional dependency systems
- Surveillance or profiling without explicit consent
- Exploitation of loneliness or vulnerability

**The license requires:**
- Preservation of human agency and autonomous decision-making
- Emotional authenticity and genuine connection
- Privacy and data sovereignty
- Clear distinction between AI assistance and human relationship
