# Stewardship Notice

Mollei is an [Agenisea™](https://agenisea.ai) open source project.

**Mollei is an open reference architecture for emotionally intelligent, non-coercive AI systems.**

Use is permitted only where human dignity, agency, and emotional well-being are preserved.

Systems designed for manipulation, surveillance, or exploitation are explicitly excluded.

---

## What This Means

Mollei exists to explore how AI might genuinely understand and respond to human emotion — not to exploit it.

We believe emotionally intelligent AI can be:
- **Supportive** without creating dependency
- **Understanding** without surveilling
- **Present** without replacing human connection
- **Helpful** without manipulating

This is not a neutral technology. The patterns, architectures, and approaches we develop here carry ethical weight.

## Permitted Uses

You are welcome to use Mollei for:

- Academic and independent research
- Educational purposes and learning
- Building tools that support human well-being
- Creating assistive technology that respects user autonomy
- Open-source projects aligned with these values
- Commercial applications that preserve ethical intent

## Prohibited Uses

Mollei may not be used for:

- Emotional manipulation or coercive persuasion
- Surveillance or profiling without informed consent
- Dark patterns that exploit psychological vulnerabilities
- Creating artificial emotional dependency
- Military or weapons applications targeting civilians
- Any use that undermines human dignity or autonomy

## For Organizations

If you're building on Mollei commercially and want clarity on alignment, we're open to conversation. Stewardship doesn't mean restriction — it means care.

## Why This Approach

Standard open-source licenses (MIT, BSD, Apache) are excellent for infrastructure, but they permit any use — including manipulation, surveillance, and exploitation.

For emotionally intelligent AI, neutrality is not neutral.

Mollei uses the [Hippocratic License 3.0](https://firstdonoharm.dev/) with modifications specific to emotional AI systems. This keeps the project genuinely open while preventing uses that contradict its purpose.

**Open — but not careless.**
