If you're in crisis, please know you're not alone:
- National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 988 (US)
- Crisis Text Line: Text HOME to 741741
- International Association for Suicide Prevention: https://www.iasp.info/resources/Crisis_Centres/

I'm here with you, and these resources are too.`

I want to make sure I'm being helpful. If you're going through something difficult, talking to someone who can really support you—like a counselor, therapist, or trusted friend—can make a real difference.`

What you're experiencing sounds significant. While I'm here to listen, a counselor or therapist can offer the kind of ongoing support that might be really valuable right now. Would you like to talk about what finding that kind of support might look like?`
